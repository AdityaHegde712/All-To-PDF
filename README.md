# All-To-PDF
Features:
* Read through folders and subfolders for files, add them to a pdf document.
* Top folder will be the name of the PDF
* Subfolders will be section headings
* Each file name will be considered a page heading, and the contents of the file become the page contents.
* This effectively reproduces all content as a report that's immediately submit-able for college students, rather than having to manually copy, reformat, etc. 
* Standard used fonts for headings etc will be updated in future.
