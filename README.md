# All-To-PDF
Features:
* Read through folders and subfolders for files, add them to a pdf document.
* Top folder will be the name of the PDF
* Subfolders will be section headings
* Each file name will be considered a page heading, and the contents of the file become the page contents.
* This effectively reproduces all content as a report that's immediately submit-able for college students, rather than having to manually copy, reformat, etc. 
* Standard used fonts for headings etc will be updated in future. 
* The program can also read from an existing PDF if you want it to append new pages instead (useful when adding more content), but this feature will be added after the prior ones are implemented.
